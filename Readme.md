# Practice Repository - CP Problems

This repo is kind of my personal problem solving practice cloud. The solutions contained herein are mostly the easy ones from various CP platforms eg. Codeforces, Leetcode, Hackerrank, HackerEarth. The files are named so that the problems get cross-referenced 

Because code is just a structured language to give instructions - it's the thought behind the implementation that counts - essentially the logic of why we do what we do. I have primarily implemented my solutions in Python (because of my familiarity with its syntax, the abundance of libraries,  packages). I have also tried to solve some of the same problems in C, CPP, JS, TS & rolling additions. To practice statistical analysis, R is used and for data analysis some basic SQL Practice scripts are there

Whilst I am pretty aware of the rudimentary nature of the code written as I lack any formal training. I am maintaining this repo to stay engaged in solving these problems (and mostly maintain a hobby - in accounting sense 'spending' time) and I thought doing git add, git commit, git push would be something to do :smile:
