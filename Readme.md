# Practice Repository - CP Problems

This repo is kind of my personal problem solving practice cloud. The solutions contained herein are mostly the easy ones from various CP platforms eg. Codeforces, Leetcode, Hackerrank, HackerEarth etc. 

Because code is just a language - it's the thought that counts. So I have primarily implemented my solutions in Python (because of familiarity with its syntax and the abundance of libraries,  packages). I have also dabbled in some C, CPP, JS, TS & rolling routine additions. In addition to that, to practice statistical analysis, R is used and for data analysis some SQL practice scripts are there.

Whilst I am pretty aware of the rudimentary nature of the code written, I seek forgiveness in that I have not been formally trained in computer science.This repo is being maintained to keep me engaged in solving these problems (and mostly maintain a hobby) and I thought doing git add, git commit, git push would be cool :smile:
