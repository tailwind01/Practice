This repo is kind of my personal code practice cloud. It contains solutions to practice problems (mostly the easy ones) available on various competitive coding platforms (Codeforces, Leetcode, Hackerearth, Hackerrank, Codechef etc.). In addition to that, to practice statistical analysis, R is used and for data analysis some SQL practice scripts are there.

Primarily Python, but also C, CPP, R, SQL, JS, TS & rolling routine additions etc
