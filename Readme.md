This repo is kind of my personal code practice cloud. It contains solutions to practice problems (mostly the easy ones) available on various competitive coding platforms (Codeforces, Leetcode, Hackerearth, Hackerrank, Codechef etc.). In addition to that, to practice statistical analysis, R is used and for data analysis some SQL practice scripts are there.

Languages in which this practice is done is Python, C, CPP, R and SQL. Comments are added to the code wherever necessary.
